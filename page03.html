Once he was released back in September 2020, Razor was considered to be one of, if not the, strongest DPS character at the time, despite his lower rarity. Since then, he was pushed down the DPS tier list with the release of new and more complex characters. However, one of his greatest assets is the fact that he is a four-star character which means that players can much more easily acquire his Constellations compared to the game's five-stars.</h3></div>

Kazuha, meanwhile, first appeared in Version 1.6 and despite appearing in the game's story since then, he's long overdue for a Banner rerun. Kazuha was rumored to get a rerun in both Versions 2.4 and 2.6, so this latest leak putting him Genshin Impact 2.8 should be taken with a grain of salt. He's a popular character, though, so HoYoverse could certainly be getting ready to rerun him. The compiled leaks from Reddit can be found below:.</h3></div>

Although once a Fatui herself, Collei has sworn vengeance against the Fatui Barnabas and is one of the main characters in the manga. In various chapters, she has teamed up with recognizable allies like Kaeya and Amber. In Chapter 16, she leaves Mondstadt to follow Cyno into Sumeru, which is why it seems so likely that she'll appear in the Genshin Impact 3.0 update.</h3></p></div>

(Think Dragonspine, but you know, underground.) With it, comes a new Archon Quest with Dainsleif called “Requiem of the Echoing Depths” that will dive into the connection between the Traveler Twins and Khaenri’a. Footage of the area showed a dark and vast underground world that looks like it used to be a mine. As players explore it, they’ll need to use a special item called a Lumenstone Adjuvant to light up and navigate its dark caves..</h3></div>
